# a, an

Use “a” before consonant sounds and “an” before vowel sounds (this is based on the sound, not whether the first letter of the word is a consonant or vowel). _A Master of Arts degree, an MA degree._[^24]

[^24]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/a-an](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/a-an)

# abbreviations, acronyms

Avoid long acronyms and using multiple acronyms in a series. When using an acronym, be sure the complete name has been spelled out at least once. According to AP, the acronym does not have to follow the formal name in parenthesis, but instead the acronym should be recognizable on its own when used.

Use periods in certain two-letter abbreviations (U.S., U.N.), but not for GI, ID, ABD, FBI, CIA, GOP or other recognizable acronyms. In most cases omit periods unless the acronym would spell an unrelated word. Follow Webster’s New World College Dictionary where applicable.[^3]

# academic degrees

Degree names are possessive when the word “degree” is present or understood (bachelor’s, master’s degree, but “associate” is not possessive in “associate degree”). Degree names are never possessive in the case of Bachelor of Arts, Master of Science, Juris Master, or etc.

EdS is the abbreviation for Educational Specialist (not education specialist).

Doctoral is an adjective; doctorate is a noun. Refer to the degree as a doctorate or a doctoral degree, not a doctorate degree.

Do not use periods in degree name abbreviations unless specifically mandated by the department.[^25]

* Correct: MA, EdS, etc.
* Incorrect: M.A., Ed.S., etc.

Marketing always capitalizes majors/specialties in degree names: _Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics, master’s in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics._[^26]

We do not use periods in degree abbreviations per Strategic Communications, though the AP Stylebook disagrees.

[^26]: Capitalizing the specialty in regard to the degree program is Marketing custom, in contrast to AP guidance. See [https://www.apstylebook.com/ask\_the\_editors/4496](https://www.apstylebook.com/ask_the_editors/4496) and [https://www.apstylebook.com/ask\_the\_editors/28564](https://www.apstylebook.com/ask_the_editors/28564).

# academic departments

Lowercase references to departments except when using proper nouns or when “department” is part of the official and formal name: _The University of Alabama Department of History, the department of history_, _the history department_, _the department of English_, _the English department_. Also: _Students may count up to 18 hours in sociology, French or political science toward the major_ (never _... 18 hours in SOC, FR or PSC ..._).[^27]

[^27]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/academic-departments](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/academic-departments). Strategic Communications has stated they follow AP style in this regard.


# academic honors

Lowercase and do not italicize — cum laude, magna cum laude, summa cum laude[^1].

[^1]: [AP](https://www.apstylebook.com/merriam_webster/merriam-webster-c-cum-laude) via Merriam-Webster; Strategic Communications.



# academic titles

Capitalize formal titles when used immediately before a name. Lowercase formal titles when used alone or in constructions that set them off from a name by commas: _Dean Robert Tidwell_, but _Dr. Robert Tidwell, dean of the Extension Division_.[^28]

[^28]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/academic-titles](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/academic-titles), [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/capitalization](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/capitalization) (“Titles” section)

# addresses

In publications, it’s Marketing custom not to list box numbers or fax numbers. Most contact blocks include name, position, phone number and email. State the specific college only if it’s otherwise unclear from the rest of the material or for an interdisciplinary degree. Usually it’s not necessary to include “The University of Alabama” in a contact block. For instance:

Dr. Jane Smith  
Faculty Program Coordinator  
205-555-1212  
person.name@ua.edu



# admissions representative

“Admissions representative/admissions representatives” is the preferred title for members of the Recruitment team. Replaces previous usage of “enrollment counselors" and "admissions counselors.”[^29]

[^29]: Per email to Marketing team 4/6/2018; revised 2024.

# advisor

2022 guidance from Strategic Communications says “advisor” is acceptable for any context except “news releases,” where “adviser” is preferred.[^30] For Marketing purposes, “advisor” will be used most often.

[^30]: Strategic Communications, [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/adviser](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/adviser)

# ages

Always use figures (the number, not spelled out) for ages. Use hyphens for ages expressed as adjectives before a noun or as substitutes for a noun: _A 5-year-old boy_, but _the boy is 5 years old_. _The boy, 7, has a sister, 10._ _The woman, 33, has a daughter 2 months old._ _The race is for 3-year-olds._ _Many distance students are in their 60s_ (no apostrophe).[^4]

# alignment, justification

Text alignment may be “ragged” (text does not line up straight on right side) or justified. When text is justified, be sure the justification isn’t causing unsightly spaces in paragraphs. Consider left justification instead of full justification.



# all but dissertation, ABD

Listed in Webster’s New World College Dictionary without periods. Consider “PhD candidate” as an alternative.[^31]

[^31]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ask\_the\_editors/27465](https://www.apstylebook.com/ask_the_editors/27465)

# a.m., p.m.

Lowercase, with periods,[^32] and preceded by a space: _7 p.m., 9–11 a.m._, _9 a.m. to 5 p.m._

# ampersand (&)

Try not to use an ampersand unless absolutely necessary for space reasons or if it’s part of the official name of an organization.[^5]

[^5]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/ampersand](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/ampersand)

# assure, ensure, insure

Use “assure” in the context of “to make sure” or “give confidence.” Use “ensure” for “guarantee.” “Insure” should only be used to specifically refer to insurance. Often when “insure” is used, “ensure” is the intended word.[^33]

[^33]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/ensure-insure-assure](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/ensure-insure-assure)

# asterisk (*)

An asterisk commonly indicates the presence of a note following a set of paragraphs or a table.\*

\*For example, this would be a note that would explain something about the text above.

Asterisks are often used in pairs — one in the text and one before the note. There is no space between the end of a word or sentence and an asterisk, and there is no space between an asterisk and the start of a note.

Use an asterisk like a numbered footnote, except that an asterisk can be used multiple times to connect different text to the same note.

If multiple unique notes are needed, then a series of asterisks can be used (\*, \*\*, \*\*\*). After three asterisks, use up to three daggers (†), then up to three double daggers (‡). When multiple asterisks or other symbols are present, consider if the information can be presented more simply. Asterisks should only be used when absolutely necessary to clarify a text.

Asterisk levels should be sequential — the first asterisk appearing on a page would be the single asterisk, the second asterisk appearing would be the double asterisk, etc. The notes would also appear in the sequential order of the asterisk levels.

If a note pertains to every item in a table, then no asterisks are needed, and the note should just appear before or after the table. Usually “Note:” is not needed with an asterisk note because the asterisk signifies a note.

A note with an asterisk usually does not also need to be in bold or italics. Do not use an asterisk just for emphasis (for example, _\*\*Note …_); only use corresponding asterisks to explain something in a text.



# autoresponder

Per Webster’s.

# award-winning

Hyphenated as a compound adjective: _UA’s award-winning Culverhouse College of Business_.[^35]

# Black Belt

Refers to an area of land across central Alabama.[^1] Two words and capitalized.

[^1]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/merriam_webster/merriam-webster-geographical-black-belt](https://www.apstylebook.com/merriam_webster/merriam-webster-geographical-black-belt)

# capitalization

Do not capitalize short forms of the names of University programs and facilities: _the greenhouse, the arboretum, the law school, the education library, the financial aid office,_ _the registrar’s office_, etc. Do capitalize formal names of facilities: _the Writing Center, the Office of the University Registrar, Gorgas Library, the Gadsden Center._

Do not capitalize the names of disciplines such as history, art, etc., unless derived from proper nouns: _Students may count up to 18 hours in sociology, French or political science toward the major._ Marketing always capitalizes majors/specialties in degree names, however: _Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics, master’s in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics._

Do not capitalize the common names of semesters, terms, academic sessions or periods, such as _fall semester, registration_, _orientation_ and _commencement_. If a semester or term is followed by a specific year, use capitalization: _Fall Semester 2024; the program began in Spring 2015_.[^6]

## Compositions
 Capitalize the principal words in the names of books, movies, poems, songs, radio and television programs, works of art, etc.[^7]

# Capstone, the

Nickname for The University of Alabama. The "the" is not capitalized. Also, when referring to a culminating "capstone project" in a program, the word is not capitalized. _Students appreciated the academic rigor of the Capstone. She completed a culminating capstone research project during her final semester._

[^1]: Strategic Communications

# certificates, forms

General terms used to describe forms should not be capitalized: _application for admission, financial aid forms_.

When a number is part of a form’s title, use the numerical figure and omit any punctuation:

*   Incorrect: Form 1,040EZ
*   Correct: Form 1040EZ
*   Incorrect: Form Two-A
*   Correct: Form 2A

In the title of a form, capitalize the first word and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs: _Form I-20AB Certificate of Eligibility, IAP-66 Certificate of Eligibility, Free Application for Federal Student Aid._

## Certificate/certification
If the formal name (“A,” Class A, etc.) is included, then “certificate” is capitalized (_Class AA Certificate_). If both the formal name and program area are included, then “certification” is capitalized (_Alabama Class A Certification in School Psychometry_), or otherwise “certification” is lowercase (_Class AA certification_). In a case where the formal name and program area are included and “certification” might be uppercase, such as “Alabama Class A Certification in School Psychometry,” consider if “Certificate” can be substituted (_Alabama Class A Certificate in School Psychometry_).

Quotation marks are not used with the class of the certification unless the letter stands on its own.

_Class AA Certificate, Class AA certification, Class A Professional Certificate, the “A” Certification in School Psychometry, master’s level certificate in special education, Alabama Class B Professional Educator Certificate, Alabama Class A Certificate in School Psychometry, Alabama Class A Certification in School Psychometry, Alabama Class A certification._[^78]

The words “graduate certificate” should always be lowercase (except in headings, etc.), but capitalize the major: _graduate certificate in Conflict Resolution_.

[^78]: Strategic Communications

# certification, concentration, focus, specialization

For documents like the annual UA Online Guide brochure, there is different punctuation for listing certificates, concentrations, focuses and specializations. Focuses get parenthesis, specializations and concentrations get “specialization/concentration in” (set off by comma) and certifications are just set off by commas after the degree name and major. Use these standards as a guide, though usage may differ depending on the document.

*   Certification: MA in Educational Leadership, Instructional Leadership P-12 Certification
*   Concentration: MS in Consumer Sciences, concentration in Family Financial Planning & Counseling
*   Focus: MS in HES (Consumer Quality Management)
*   Specialization: MA in Communication Studies, specialization in Organizational Leadership

Because “concentration” and “specialization” (also “conditional”) are specific degree program terms, they should not be used often except in reference to those programs. Avoid the phrase “conditional admission.”



# co-worker

Per [AP Stylebook](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/coworking-n-adj).

# colon (:)

Capitalize the first word after a colon only if it is a proper noun or the start of a complete sentence: _He promised this: The surgery would repair the lower intestine_, but _There were three dessert choices: cake, pie and Jell-O._[^8]

## Lists
A colon should not be used before a list of items that completes the sentence as a direct object. If a sentence would be understandable without the colon, omit the colon.

*   Incorrect: The five courses she took were: MATH 125, EN 102, IE 203, COM 203 and ARH 151.
*   Correct: The five courses she took were MATH 125, EN 102, IE 203, COM 203 and ARH 151.[^9]

# comma (,)

The University of Alabama follows Associated Press style, which does not use the serial or Oxford comma (omit the comma before the conjunction in most sentences): _The flag is red, white and blue. They would nominate Nick, Terry or Paul._

Include a final comma in a simple series if omitting it could make the meaning unclear. _At the graduation reception I met my professors, Big Al and President Bell_ (where Big Al and President Bell could be interpreted as the professors) versus _At the graduation reception, I met my professors, Big Al, and President Bell._

## Names of states and nations used with city names
 _His journey will take him from Dublin, Ireland, to Fargo, North Dakota, and back. The Selma, Alabama, group saw the governor._

## Separating similar words
 Use a comma to separate duplicated words: _What the problem is, is not clear._

## Placement with quotes
 Commas always go inside quotation marks.

## With conjunctions
 Use a comma when “and,” “but” or “for” links two clauses that could be their own sentences: _Alabama is a great school, and I will be proud to graduate from there._ The comma can be dropped if the clauses are short: _We went to Lakeside and I ate ice cream._

Do not use a comma when the subject of two clauses is not repeated in the second clause: _We went to Coleman Coliseum and saw the players_ (clauses share the subject "We," so no comma is used). _We went to Coleman Coliseum, and we saw the players_ (each clause has its own subject, "We" and "we," so a comma is used).

## With equal adjectives
 Use commas to separate equal adjectives where “and” could be substituted instead: _a distance, accredited business program_ (a program that’s both distance and accredited). Do not use a comma when the adjectives are not equal or one adjective modifies the other: _a weekend distance program_ (distance programs only offered on the weekends).

## With full dates
 When a phrase refers to a month, day and year, set off the year with a comma: _February 14, 2030, is the target date_.[^10]

See also: [dates]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _entries/dates.md %}).

# course numbers, course titles

The parts of a course name are the alpha symbol (EN), course number (101) and title (English Composition). When an alpha symbol, number and title are given together, there is no punctuation between the course number and title. When possible, try not to abbreviate words in the course title.

*   ART 224 Introduction to Digital Art
*   EE 350 Electromechanics
*   EN 398 Modernism I: The Cultural Context

When a course title is given without the course number, uppercase the course title as long as it is the complete title: _Introduction to Art History_.

Do not use alpha symbols when referring generally to a department or program’s courses or an academic discipline.

*   Incorrect: Students may count up to 18 hours in SOC, FR or PSC toward the major.
*   Correct: Students may count up to 18 hours in sociology, French or political science toward the major.

When listing courses by number, repeat the alpha symbol with each number.

*   Incorrect: The required courses include EN 101, 205, and 209 or 210.
*   Correct: The required courses include EN 101, EN 205, and EN 209 or EN 210.

Use a colon to indicate two courses that are lecture-and-laboratory combinations: _AY 101:102_. The alpha symbol is not repeated.

Cross-listed courses offered for both undergraduate and graduate credit with two course numbers may be written with a slash: _EN 480/580_. The alpha symbol is not repeated.

Do not use a colon or a slash with courses except to indicate lecture-and-laboratory or cross-listed courses.[^79]

# coursework

One word. Per Strategic Communications, “Generally refers to the courses taken for degree credit.”[^37]

[^37]: Strategic Communications

# credit hours

Use of the term “credit hours” is preferred over “semester hours.” Use figures no matter how small the number. Hyphenate the phrase only when used as a modifier. _Her psychology internship was 15 credit hours. EN 101 is a 3-credit-hour course._



# cross-list


No AP or Webster’s guidance, but the UA Office of the University Registrar seems to favor “cross-list”: [https://registrar.ua.edu/faculty-staff/academic-scheduling-roomseek/cross-listing-policy](https://registrar.ua.edu/faculty-staff/academic-scheduling-roomseek/cross-listing-policy).

# dash, hyphen

A dash is used for a break in a sentence or to represent omitted words ( — or – ); a dash is formed using special keystrokes.

A hyphen is used to join words ( - ); it is smaller and found as a regular button on the keyboard.

## Dashes
 The “em dash” and “en dash” are types of dashes used for different purposes; they are named for their size (the width of a letter m or letter n respectively). The following table describes how to create an em dash or an en dash on a Windows or Mac computer or in HTML, or acceptable substitutions to use if necessary.

     
|  |   Windows   |   Mac   |   HTML   |   HTML (alt)   |   Substitution   |
| 
--- | 
--- | 
--- | 
--- | 
--- | 
--- |
|   Em dash ( — )   |   Ctrl + Alt + minus   |   Shift + Opt + minus   |   &mdash;   |   &#8212;   |   \--   |
|   En dash ( – )   |   Ctrl + minus   |   Opt + minus   |   &ndash;   |   &#8211;   |   \-   |

## Em dash ( — )
 Used for emphasis (one em dash) or to indicate a sudden break in thought (a pair of em dashes). Always use spaces around an em dash. Do not use more than one pair of em dashes in a sentence (consider commas and parentheses as alternatives).

*   Correct: I was fine until the last assignment — the final exam.
*   Correct: EN 101 English Composition I — an introduction to college-level writing — is required of all UA freshmen.
*   Incorrect: We went to the stadium — it was big — and watched a game — we won! — on Saturday.

Use an em dash before a person’s name at the end of a quotation, set off from the name by a space: _“UA Online helped me earn my degree.” — Big Al._[^11]

## En dash ( – )
 Often used with number ranges (for example, _2009–2010, children ages 1–5_). In this context, the en dash acts as a substitute for the word “to.”

## Hyphen
 Refer to Webster’s New World College Dictionary for whether a phrase requires a hyphen. Otherwise, fewer hyphens are better and use them mainly to avoid confusion: _small-business owner, health care center. He recovered his health. She re-covered the leaky roof. The story is a re-creation. The park is for recreation. They are nontraditional students._

## Compound modifiers
 When a compound modifier — two or more words that express a single concept — precedes a noun, use hyphens to link the words. Do not use a hyphen after “very” or adverbs that end in “-ly”: _a first-quarter touchdown, a bluish-green dress, a full-time job, a well-known city, a very good time, a newly purchased phone. Students must complete 61 credit hours of general education and lower-division requirements prior to enrolling into upper-division courses._

Most combinations of words are not hyphenated after a noun, but are hyphenated after a form of the verb “to be”: _The team scored in the first quarter. She works full time_. _The children are soft-spoken. The play is second-rate._

AP states no hyphen in “master’s level,” as in “master’s level teaching certification.”

Use a space for phrases with a common element (“suspensive hyphenation”): _It is a three- to five-year program. The program can be completed in three to five years._[^12]

# dates

Write month and date as March 2, not March 2nd. Use a comma to set off the year when the phrase refers to a month, date and year: _They won the championship on January 9, 2017, and everyone celebrated._

See also: [months]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _entries/months.md %}).

# decision-making

Hyphenated as “decision-making” for noun or adjective.[^40]

[^40]: An earlier version of Strategic Communications differed from AP “Ask the Editor” ([https://www.apstylebook.com/ask\_the\_editors/27610](https://www.apstylebook.com/ask_the_editors/27610)) on “decision-making.” Recent versions of the Strategic Communications editorial guide omit their guidance; at the same time, Webster’s also specifies “decision-making” in all uses.

# dietitian, dietician

Dietitian is the preferred spelling.[^41]

[^41]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/dietitian](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/dietitian)

# directions, regions

Lowercase “north,” “south,” “northeast,” “southern,” etc., when they indicate compass direction; capitalize these words when they designate widely known regions.

_The cold front is moving east. A storm system that developed in the Midwest is spreading eastward._ _It will bring showers to the East Coast by morning and to the entire Northeast by late in the day._ _She has a Southern accent. This scholarship is for students from south Alabama._

## With names of nations
Lowercase directions unless they are part of a proper name or are used to designate a politically divided nation: _northern France, eastern Canada, the western United States, but Northern Ireland, South Korea_.

## With states and cities
Lowercase directions when referring to a section of a state or city, but capitalize when part of a proper name: _western Montana,_ _southern Atlanta_, but _North Dakota, West Virginia_. Capitalize for widely known sections: _the South Side of Chicago, the Lower East Side of New York_. When in doubt, use lowercase.[^42]

# free

Marketing custom is to use “free” only for items with value (a mug, a thermos), and not for items with no price value (a brochure download, an information kit).



# full time, full-time

Hyphenate when used as a compound modifier: _She has a full-time job. He works full time._[^48]

# head start

Not hyphenated, per Merriam-Webster.[^1]

[^1]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/merriam_webster/merriam-webster-h-head-start](https://www.apstylebook.com/merriam_webster/merriam-webster-h-head-start)

# headings

When writing headings in “headline case” or “title case” (most words capitalized), follow these guidelines:

*   Capitalize the first and last words of the heading.
*   Lowercase articles (_a, an, the_), conjunctions (_and, but, for_) and prepositions of less than four letters (_at, by_).
*   Capitalize most other words, including prepositions and conjunctions that are four or more letters. Verbs are capitalized, including “being” verbs (_is, are, was_).
*   If a hyphenated word appears in a title, capitalize both words in the phrase (_The Star-Spangled Banner_).[^13]
*   Most headings do not require periods, though periods may be used for clarity with multiple headings. Exclamation and question marks are acceptable where appropriate.

_Your Future Is Our Business, Let Your Computer Be Your Campus, Where Legends Log In, The Path to Leadership Starts at Your Fingertips, Become a Leader in Your School, For Whom the Bell Tolls, Prepare for a Career in Higher Education, Get Ahead With a Degree._

# health care

Two words. AP differs from Webster’s on this. Also “health care industry” and “health care provider” with no hyphens.[^51] If an organization uses “healthcare” as one word in their name (e.g., IHI, the Institute for Healthcare Improvement), defer to their usage when referring to the organization.

# hyperlinks

For accessibility purposes, it’s Marketing custom to avoid the use of “click here” when possible. A better practice is to hyperlink relevant words (“admissions information” in “Review the most current admissions information,” “website” in “Visit our website”) or phrases like “select an option below to learn more,” “learn more here,” or “find out more.”



# in-

Follow Webster’s New World College Dictionary when in doubt: _inbound, indoor, in-depth, in-house, in-group, in-law_.[^14]

[^14]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/in-2](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/in-2)

# internet

Lowercase “internet” in all uses. The term “broadband internet” (really “broadband internet connection,” but often shortened to “broadband internet”) refers to connections that are not dial-up, including DSL and cable. “Ethernet” (capitalized) refers to a kind of wired connection used with broadband; “Wi-Fi” (also capitalized) is a wireless connection. To refer to a non-Wi-Fi connection where a computer must be “plugged in” to the internet, use “wired.”[^52]

[^52]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/internet-2](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/internet-2)

# K-12

Uppercase K in all uses of K-12 (but lowercase “kindergarten” or “kindergartners”).[^53] P-12 (including preschool) is treated the same.

# lifelong

One word, adjective.[^54]

[^54]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ask\_the\_editors/6877](https://www.apstylebook.com/ask_the_editors/6877)

# like, as

Use “like” for comparison; use “as” to introduce clauses. _Quinnen blocks like a pro,_ but _Isaiah blocked the linebacker as if the game depended on it._[^55]

[^55]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/like-as](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/like-as)

# lists

Vertical lists may be bulleted or numbered/lettered.

When bulleted items are sentences, capitalize the first letter of each sentence and use appropriate ending punctuation. When bulleted items consist of single words or phrases, lowercase the first letter and do not use punctuation.

Strive for consistency. If one item in a bulleted list has a period, end all the items with a period even if they’re not all sentences (but try not to mix-and-match sentences and non-sentences). If some items begin with verbs, begin all items with verbs.

_The benefits of membership include:_

*   _special invitations to all UA sporting events_
*   _The Sportsfan, the club’s bimonthly newsletter_
*   _a Sports Club hangtag_
*   _a free T-shirt for members and their spouses_

_To help make your college experience a pleasant and successful one, keep these suggestions in mind:_

*   _Register for classes._
*   _Show up for classes._
*   _Buy the required books._
*   _Graduate!_[^15]

Use numbered or lettered lists (numbered preferred) when referring back to an item (“see number 15 above”); otherwise consider using bullets. Also use numbered lists when a sequence of steps is implied. Use 1. or a. without parenthesis.

1.  _Download the application file._
2.  _Pay the application fee through the online system._
3.  _Upload your completed application and select “Submit.”_

## Run-in list
 A run-in list usually does not need a colon, especially if the list items are part of the sentence.

*   Incorrect: _Positions include: quarterback, running back and lineman_.
*   Correct: _Positions include quarterback, running back and lineman_.

If the text will need to refer back to items in a run-in list, use letters or numbers enclosed in parentheses. Use commas or semicolons to separate these items exactly as if there were no numbers or letters. _They decided to (1) introduce a new program, (2) advertise it and (3) enroll students._

See also: [colon]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _entries/colon.md %}).

[^15]: Per previous Strategic Communications guidelines and Marketing custom.

# longtime, long time

Use _longtime_ as a modifier: _She is a longtime advocate of the program_. The two words, _long time_, stand alone to describe a length of time: _They have been looking forward to graduation for a long time_.[^1]

# -maker

Follow Webster’s New World College Dictionary. If the word combination is not listed, use two words for the verb form and hyphenate any noun or adjective forms.[^56]

[^56]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/maker](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/maker)

# makeup, make up

One word for the noun and adjective forms, two words for the verb form (per AP, currently the hyphenated form "make-up" would never be correct).[^1] _They will need to make up the exam. The instructor offered a makeup exam. TH 230 teaches students about stage makeup._

[^1]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/makeup](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/makeup)

# Master of Public Health (MPH)

Use Master of Public Health (MPH) instead of “master’s degree in public health” or MS in Public Health.



# master teacher, teacher leader

These are lowercase, as they are more often used as a general term than a formal job title.



# Microsite Contact Page Sample

Microsite contact pages consist of one (usually) or more contact blocks for the admissions counselor and also general UA Online contact information.

The admissions counselor contact header is “Program Information” and the UA Online contact header is “Admissions Information.”

The word “registration” is found on some older microsites but should be removed (the UA Online recruitment team offers admission assistance but not registration assistance).

# midterm

Per Strategic Communications.

# months

Abbreviate *Jan., Feb., Aug., Sept., Oct., Nov.* and *Dec.* when used with a specific date. Spell out when using alone or with a year alone.

_She graduated in December 2024. The deadline to apply for the fall term is Aug. 1. He announced his retirement on Jan. 10, 2024, and we wished him well._

# much-needed

Hyphenated as a compound modifier: _much-needed experience._[^58]

[^58]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ask\_the\_editors/5190](https://www.apstylebook.com/ask_the_editors/5190)

# non-

Usually not hyphenated when used before a word starting with a consonant, e.g., _nontraditional, nonrefundable, noncompliance, nondegree_. Use a hyphen before proper nouns or in awkward combinations, such as _non-nuclear_.[^59] Consult the Merriam-Webster dictionary for more guidance.

[^59]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/prefixes](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/prefixes), [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/non](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/non)

# numbers, numerals

In general, spell out one through nine and use figures for 10 or above.

Exceptions: Use figures for credit hours, ages and whenever preceding a unit of measurement; always spell out numbers at the start of a sentence (except for years).

_The Tide finished first. He had nine laps to go. Fourth grade, the First Amendment, the 11th annual county fair, fifth century, 21st century. A 5-year-old boy_, but _the boy is 5 years old_. _The student is in his 70s._ _EN 101 is a 3-credit-hour course. Students must complete 30 credit hours._

## Dates, years and decades
 _Class of ’66, the 1950s, Feb. 8, 2007_. Use a comma to set off the year when the phrase refers to a month, date and year. _They won the championship on January 9, 2017, and everyone celebrated._

## Grade point averages
 Use figures for grade point averages. Always include the decimal point and carry to at least one decimal place (2.0); when citing several GPAs, extend them all to the same (highest) decimal place (2.18, 4.00).

## In a series
 Apply the standard guidelines mentioned above: _They had 10 dogs, six cats and 97 hamsters. They had four four-room houses, 10 three-room houses and 12 10-room houses._

## Military ranks
 _1st Sgt. Jane Smith_, but _Smith was a second lieutenant._

## Ranges
 _Every two to three weeks_, but _a two-to-three-week session_ (if the numbers are part of a compound modifier). Be careful not to confuse numerical ranges with suspensive hyphenation. A numerical range would be, “They ran five-to-10-minute laps” (the laps were anywhere from five to 10 minutes); suspensive hyphenation indicates separate items, like “They alternated between five- and 10-minute intervals.”

## School grades
 Spell out first through ninth grades: _fourth grade, fifth-grader_ (note hyphen). Use figures for grades 10 and above: _10th grade._

## Test scores
Use figures for SAT, ACT and similar test scores. Use figures in constructions such as SAT-1. Do not add commas to SAT or other scores that reach into the thousands: _Her GRE composite score was 2070_.

## Times
 Use figures for time of day except for noon and midnight: _1 p.m., 10:30 a.m., 5 o’clock_. Spell out numbers less than 10 standing alone and in modifiers: _I’ll be there in five minutes. The two-minute warning._[^16]

## With parenthesis
 In general, a spelled-out number does not also need the figure in parentheses. In cases where this is necessary (for instance, customary on Program Development program plans), numbers one through nine (or any spelled-out number that starts a sentence) can be followed by the figure in parenthesis if the number is being compared: _We enrolled eight (8) students in the fall, a 33 percent increase from six (6) students in the spring,_ but _We held one information session in the fall._

[^16]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap\_stylebook/numerals](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/numerals); Strategic Communications. For ranges, these guidelines differ from AP per this AP “Ask the Editor” discussion: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ask\_the\_editors/32472](https://www.apstylebook.com/ask_the_editors/32472).

# Nurse Education, Nurse Educators

The formal name of the interdisciplinary nursing degree with courses taught by Nursing and College of Education faculty is the EdD in Instructional Leadership, concentration in Nurse Education. However, an acceptable short form (preferably after the formal name has been used) is the “EdD for nurse educators” (the difference is “in Nurse Education” vs. “for nurse educators”). The phrase “nurse educators” should generally be lowercase, but can be capitalized in lists, etc. when used to help clarify the degree’s purpose.



# off campus, off-campus, on campus, on-campus

Hyphenate when used as a modifier but not when “campus” is used as a noun.

*   At UA, on-campus housing is plentiful and convenient.
*   Students who live on campus also find it affordable.
*   Off-campus apartments range in cost from $350 to $1,100 per month.
*   That building is located just off campus on Queen City Avenue.[^60]

# percent, percentile (%)

Use figures for cardinal numbers regardless of the amount, but spell out one through nine for ordinal numbers: _1%_, _2.5%_, _10%, 4 percentage points, third percentile, 22nd percentile._ Use the % sign when paired with a numeral, with no space: _Average hourly pay rose 3.1% from a year ago; her mortgage rate is 4.75%; about 60% of Americans agreed_. (Using the percent symbol instead of “percent” is a change the AP Stylebook made to their long-standing guidance in 2019.)

Try to avoid starting a sentence with a percentage, but if you must then spell it out: _Eighty-nine percent of sentences don’t have to begin with a number_. In casual uses, use words rather than figures and numbers: _She said he has a zero percent chance of winning._[^63]

# program designations — online, primarily online, blended

“Distance learning program” is written without hyphens.

Adhere to the following designations when referring to degree programs.[^81]

## Fully online program
All of the program’s instruction is delivered using online courses. Program requirements and experiential learning that cannot be completed online, such as an internship or practicum, may be completed by the students individually. The fully online program designation may also include programs that require a face-to-face orientation.

## Primarily online program
Roughly 80-99% of the program’s instruction is available using online courses. The program requires some courses that include face-to-face components and also requires less than five in-person events each semester to complete organized activities such as orientation, labs or experiential learning.

## Blended program
Roughly 50-79% of the program’s instruction is delivered through online courses. The program requires some courses to have components that are completed face-to-face and requires more than five in-person events each semester to complete organized activities such as labs or experiential learning.

[^81]: Adapted from online source by Marketing associate director, February 2019.

# program-specific

With hyphen.



# publication titles

Italicize most publication titles.[^17] For magazines, capitalize and italicize “magazine” only if it’s part of the formal name of the publication — _Harper’s Magazine_ versus _Newsweek_ magazine (see each magazine website’s “About Us” page for usage).[^18] Television program names are italicized, but segments on television shows appear in quotation marks. Website names are not italicized, and the italicized name of a publication might not be italicized when referring to the website (_New York Times_ versus the New York Times website).

[^69]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ask\_the\_editors/24874](https://www.apstylebook.com/ask_the_editors/24874)


# renown, renowned

Renown" is a noun (like "fame"); "renowned" is an adjective (like "famous").[^1] _We offer renowned Social Work degrees. The Social Work degree program is renowned for its excellence. The Social Work degree program has achieved great renown._

[^1]: https://www.apstylebook.com/ask_the_editors/41995

# reprint

# rise with the Tide, Rise With the Tide

When using the phrase “rise with the Tide,” lowercase all words except “Tide” unless in a heading or other emphasized usage, per Marketing custom.

[^71]: Webster’s, [https://www.apstylebook.com/ask\_the\_editors/28133](https://www.apstylebook.com/ask_the_editors/28133)


# spacing

Marketing custom is to use one space between sentences.



# specialist, specialization

Capitalize for Educational Specialist (where EdS is a formal degree, like _Educational Specialist in Special Education_), but lowercase when not referring to a degree, like “child life specialist.”

“Specialization” does not tend to be capitalized when describing the formal name of a program (“Master of Science in Marketing with a specialization in Marketing Analytics”).

See also: [academic degrees]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _entries/academic-degrees.md %}), [Educational Specialist]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _entries/educational-specialist.md %})

# state names

In most cases, state names should be spelled out, except for space reasons. When used in the middle of a sentence, place one comma between a city and state name and another comma after the state name: _He was traveling from Nashville, Tennessee, to Austin, Texas._ _Nick said Tuscaloosa, Alabama, was his home._

These states/districts are not abbreviated in text: Alaska, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Maine, Ohio, Texas and Utah.[^19] AP guidance says to use “District of Columbia” but “Washington, D.C.,” (with periods) is acceptable. When a state name needs to be abbreviated outside of a postal address, use the state abbreviation rather than the postal abbreviation:

- Ala.
- Ariz.
- Ark.
- Calif.
- Colo.
- Conn.
- Del.
- Fla.

# students, prospective students

When referring to students who have not yet applied to a program, use “prospective students”: _Prospective students should ensure that their application credentials are submitted to the Office of Undergraduate Admissions._



# Summer On Campus

[Summer On Campus](https://uaearlycollege.ua.edu/online-and-on-campus/summer-on-campus/) is a summer program of UA Early College. The "On" in Summer On Campus is always capitalized.

# telephone numbers

Per AP (upheld by Strategic Communications), all phone numbers are written with hyphens and without parentheses. _Contact Recruitment and Admissions Services at 205-348-0089 or 800-467-0227._[^1]

[^1]: [https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/telephone-numbers](https://www.apstylebook.com/ap_stylebook/telephone-numbers)

# time zones

Daylight saving time (not “savings,” and lowercase when not referring to a specific time zone) spans the second Sunday in March through the first Sunday in November. During that time, the proper abbreviation for the Central time zone is CDT (Central Daylight Time); outside those dates, the proper abbreviation is CST (Central Standard Time). If a reference spans both times or will be used throughout the year, use “Central time” instead (with lowercase “time”).[^21] The abbreviation CT is also acceptable but not preferred.

# University of Alabama, The

Capitalize “the” whenever it would properly appear before the University’s full name in a sentence. “The” is capitalized even when we might not capitalize “the” before the names of other universities or colleges. _The best Halloween costumes are found at the Office of Teaching Innovation and Digital Education_. _For the 17th year, The University of Alabama was the champion._

For subsequent references, use “University” (when referring specifically to The University of Alabama) or “UA” (but not “U of A”).[^73]

Capitalize "University" in standalone usage when referring to The University of Alabama, but not when referring generally to educational institutions. _We told them the University was the best._ _She is deciding what university to attend._

# URLs

It is acceptable to use capital letters in the beginning (host) of a URL,[^23] but capital letters cannot be used after the first slash (the path).

# who, whom

Use “who” instead of “that” when referring to living things.

*   Incorrect: The person that brought the coffee …

“Who” is used as the subject of a sentence and “whom” is used as the object of a sentence. If you can answer the question or replace the word with “he,” “she,” or “they,” then it should be “who”; if you can answer the question or replace the word with “him,” “her,” or “them,” then it should be “whom.”

_Who brought the coffee? He brought the coffee. The advertisement was designed by whom? The advertisement was designed by her. Who reserved the room? They reserved the room. By whom was the room reserved? The room was reserved by them._[^76]
