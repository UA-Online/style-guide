# URLs

It is acceptable to use capital letters in the beginning (host) of a URL,[^23] but capital letters cannot be used after the first slash (the path). Be consistent in capitalizing URLs in a document; if one URL contains an initial capital letter, consider if the rest of the URLs in the document should have the same.
