# dash, hyphen

A dash is used for a break in a sentence or to represent omitted words ( — or – ); a dash is formed using special keystrokes.

A hyphen is used to join words ( - ); it is smaller and found as a regular button on the keyboard.

### Dashes
 The “em dash” and “en dash” are types of dashes used for different purposes; they are named for their size (the width of a letter m or letter n respectively). The following table describes how to create an em dash or an en dash on a Windows or Mac computer or in HTML, or acceptable substitutions to use if necessary.

     
|  |   Windows   |   Mac   |   HTML   |   HTML (alt)   |   Substitution   |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|   Em dash ( — )   |   Ctrl + Alt + minus   |   Shift + Opt + minus   |   &mdash;   |   &#8212;   |   \--   |
|   En dash ( – )   |   Ctrl + minus   |   Opt + minus   |   &ndash;   |   &#8211;   |   \-   |

### Em dash ( — )
 Used for emphasis (one em dash) or to indicate a sudden break in thought (a pair of em dashes). Always use spaces around an em dash. Do not use more than one pair of em dashes in a sentence (consider commas and parentheses as alternatives).

*   Correct: I was fine until the last assignment — the final exam.
*   Correct: EN 101 English Composition I — an introduction to college-level writing — is required of all UA freshmen.
*   Incorrect: We went to the stadium — it was big — and watched a game — we won! — on Saturday.

Use an em dash before a person’s name at the end of a quotation, set off from the name by a space: _“UA Online helped me earn my degree.” — Big Al._[^11]

### En dash ( – )
 Often used with number ranges (for example, _2009–2010, children ages 1–5_). In this context, the en dash acts as a substitute for the word “to.”

### Hyphen
 Refer to Webster’s New World College Dictionary for whether a phrase requires a hyphen. Otherwise, fewer hyphens are better and use them mainly to avoid confusion: _small-business owner, health care center. He recovered his health. She re-covered the leaky roof. The story is a re-creation. The park is for recreation. They are nontraditional students._

### Compound modifiers
 When a compound modifier — two or more words that express a single concept — precedes a noun, use hyphens to link the words. Do not use a hyphen after “very” or adverbs that end in “-ly”: _a first-quarter touchdown, a bluish-green dress, a full-time job, a well-known city, a very good time, a newly purchased phone. Students must complete 61 credit hours of general education and lower-division requirements prior to enrolling into upper-division courses._

Most combinations of words are not hyphenated after a noun, but are hyphenated after a form of the verb “to be”: _The team scored in the first quarter. She works full time_. _The children are soft-spoken. The play is second-rate._

AP states no hyphen in “master’s level,” as in “master’s level teaching certification.”

Use a space for phrases with a common element (“suspensive hyphenation”): _It is a three- to five-year program. The program can be completed in three to five years._[^12]
