# asterisk (*)

An asterisk commonly indicates the presence of a note following a set of paragraphs or a table.\*

\*For example, this would be a note that would explain something about the text above.

Asterisks are often used in pairs — one in the text and one before the note. There is no space between the end of a word or sentence and an asterisk, and there is no space between an asterisk and the start of a note.

Use an asterisk like a numbered footnote, except that an asterisk can be used multiple times to connect different text to the same note.

If multiple unique notes are needed, then a series of asterisks can be used (\*, \*\*, \*\*\*). After three asterisks, use up to three daggers (†), then up to three double daggers (‡). When multiple asterisks or other symbols are present, consider if the information can be presented more simply. Asterisks should only be used when absolutely necessary to clarify a text.

Asterisk levels should be sequential — the first asterisk appearing on a page would be the single asterisk, the second asterisk appearing would be the double asterisk, etc. The notes would also appear in the sequential order of the asterisk levels.

If a note pertains to every item in a table, then no asterisks are needed, and the note should just appear before or after the table. Usually “Note:” is not needed with an asterisk note because the asterisk signifies a note.

A note with an asterisk usually does not also need to be in bold or italics. Do not use an asterisk just for emphasis (for example, _\*\*Note …_); only use corresponding asterisks to explain something in a text.
