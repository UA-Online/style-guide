# Microsite Contact Page Sample

Microsite contact pages consist of one (usually) or more contact blocks for the admissions counselor and also general UA Online contact information.

The admissions counselor contact header is “Program Information” and the UA Online contact header is “Admissions Information.”

The word “registration” is found on some older microsites but should be removed (the UA Online recruitment team offers admission assistance but not registration assistance).
