# program designations — online, primarily online, blended

“Distance learning program” is written without hyphens.

Adhere to the following designations when referring to degree programs.[^81]

### Fully online program
All of the program’s instruction is delivered using online courses. Program requirements and experiential learning that cannot be completed online, such as an internship or practicum, may be completed by the students individually. The fully online program designation may also include programs that require a face-to-face orientation.

### Primarily online program
Roughly 80-99% of the program’s instruction is available using online courses. The program requires some courses that include face-to-face components and also requires less than five in-person events each semester to complete organized activities such as orientation, labs or experiential learning.

### Blended program
Roughly 50-79% of the program’s instruction is delivered through online courses. The program requires some courses to have components that are completed face-to-face and requires more than five in-person events each semester to complete organized activities such as labs or experiential learning.
