# Twitter

Write Twitter handles with an @ symbol: _We announced the information session through the UA Online Twitter account (@UAOnline)._ If the word “at” would be used in the sentence, omit it before the Twitter handle (_You can reach us on Twitter_ _@UAOnline_), though a better option is to rewrite the sentence so it doesn’t use the understood “at” (_You can reach_ _@UAOnline_ _on Twitter_).[^22]
