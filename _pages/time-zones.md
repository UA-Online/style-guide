# time zones

Daylight saving time (not “savings,” and lowercase when not referring to a specific time zone) spans the second Sunday in March through the first Sunday in November. During that time, the proper abbreviation for the Central time zone is CDT (Central Daylight Time); outside those dates, the proper abbreviation is CST (Central Standard Time). If a reference spans both times or will be used throughout the year, use “Central time” instead (with lowercase “time”).[^21] The abbreviation CT is also acceptable but not preferred.
