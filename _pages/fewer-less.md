## fewer, less

Use “fewer” for individual items and “less” for quantities and amounts. _That is 10 fewer courses than last year. Fewer than six people attended. They used less paper than before. Lunch cost less than $10_. One exception is the common expression “or less”: _The headline should be 10 words or less_.[^46]
