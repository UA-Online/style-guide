# percent, percentile (%)

Use figures for cardinal numbers regardless of the amount, but spell out one through nine for ordinal numbers: _1%_, _2.5%_, _10%, 4 percentage points, third percentile, 22nd percentile._ Use the % sign when paired with a numeral, with no space: _Average hourly pay rose 3.1% from a year ago; her mortgage rate is 4.75%; about 60% of Americans agreed_. (Using the percent symbol instead of “percent” is a change the AP Stylebook made to their long-standing guidance in 2019.)

Try to avoid starting a sentence with a percentage, but if you must then spell it out: _Eighty-nine percent of sentences don’t have to begin with a number_. In casual uses, use words rather than figures and numbers: _She said he has a zero percent chance of winning._[^63]
