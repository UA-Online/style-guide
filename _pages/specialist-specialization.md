## specialist, specialization

Capitalize for Educational Specialist in Special Education (where EdS is a formal degree), but lowercase when not referring to a degree, like “child life specialist.”

“Specialization” does not tend to be capitalized when describing the formal name of a program (“Master of Science in Marketing with a specialization in Marketing Analytics”).
