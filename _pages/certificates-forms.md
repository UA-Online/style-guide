## certificates, forms

General terms used to describe forms should not be capitalized: _application for admission, financial aid forms_.

When a number is part of a form’s title, use the numerical figure and omit any punctuation:

*   Incorrect: Form 1,040EZ
*   Correct: Form 1040EZ
*   Incorrect: Form Two-A
*   Correct: Form 2A

In the title of a form, capitalize the first word and all nouns, pronouns, adjectives, verbs and adverbs: _Form I-20AB Certificate of Eligibility, IAP-66 Certificate of Eligibility, Free Application for Federal Student Aid._

### Certificate/certification
If the formal name (“A,” Class A, etc.) is included, then “certificate” is capitalized (_Class AA Certificate_). If both the formal name and program area are included, then “certification” is capitalized (_Alabama Class A Certification in School Psychometry_), or otherwise “certification” is lowercase (_Class AA certification_). In a case where the formal name and program area are included and “certification” might be uppercase, such as “Alabama Class A Certification in School Psychometry,” consider if “Certificate” can be substituted (_Alabama Class A Certificate in School Psychometry_).

Quotation marks are not used with the class of the certification unless the letter stands on its own.

_Class AA Certificate, Class AA certification, Class A Professional Certificate, the “A” Certification in School Psychometry, master’s level certificate in special education, Alabama Class B Professional Educator Certificate, Alabama Class A Certificate in School Psychometry, Alabama Class A Certification in School Psychometry, Alabama Class A certification._[^78]

The words “graduate certificate” should always be lowercase (except in headings, etc.), but capitalize the major: _graduate certificate in Conflict Resolution_.
