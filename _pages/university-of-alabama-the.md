## University of Alabama, The

Capitalize “the” whenever it would properly appear before the University’s full name in a sentence. “The” is capitalized even when we might not capitalize “the” before the names of other universities or colleges. _The best Halloween costumes are found at the College of Continuing Studies_. _For the 17_th _year, The University of Alabama was the champion._

For subsequent references, use “University” (when referring specifically to The University of Alabama) or “UA” (but not “U of A”).[^73]
