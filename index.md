# Marketing Style Guide

Entries in this style guide are copied or adapted from The University of Alabama Strategic Communications Editorial Style Guide (Summer 2017 and subsequent versions)[^1] and the Associated Press Stylebook, and modified based on Marketing house style. Many examples in this guide are directly from those sources. The AP Stylebook also references Websterâ€™s New World College Dictionary.

Entry sources are cited when available. Content on the AP Stylebook website may be viewed through [UA Libraries](http://libdata.lib.ua.edu/login?url=https://www.apstylebook.com/ua_edu).

The Strategic Communications online guide is constantly updated, and references in this document may no longer appear on the Strategic Communications webpage.
