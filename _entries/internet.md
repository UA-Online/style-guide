# internet

Lowercase “internet” in all uses. The term “broadband internet” (really “broadband internet connection,” but often shortened to “broadband internet”) refers to connections that are not dial-up, including DSL and cable. “Ethernet” (capitalized) refers to a kind of wired connection used with broadband; “Wi-Fi” (also capitalized) is a wireless connection. To refer to a non-Wi-Fi connection where a computer must be “plugged in” to the internet, use “wired.”[^52]
