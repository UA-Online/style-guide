title: headings

When writing headings in “headline case” or “title case” (most words capitalized), follow these guidelines:

*   Capitalize the first and last words of the heading.
*   Lowercase articles (_a, an, the_), conjunctions (_and, but, for_) and prepositions of less than four letters (_at, by_).
*   Capitalize most other words, including prepositions and conjunctions that are four or more letters. Verbs are capitalized, including “being” verbs (_is, are, was_).
*   If a hyphenated word appears in a title, capitalize both words in the phrase (_The Star-Spangled Banner_).[^13]
*   Most headings do not require periods, though periods may be used for clarity with multiple headings. Exclamation and question marks are acceptable where appropriate.
