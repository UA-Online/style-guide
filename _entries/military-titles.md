title: military titles
section: Grammar/Punctuation

AP guidance is to capitalize a military rank when used as a formal title before an individual's name, but to spell out and lowercase a title when it is substituted for a name. _Gen. John Jones is the top U.S. commander in Afghanistan. The general endorsed the idea._[^1] This guidance is also reflected in the [Military OneSource](https://styleguide.militaryonesource.mil/terms/m) style guide (see "military titles").
