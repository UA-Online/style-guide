The formal name of the interdisciplinary nursing degree with courses taught by Nursing and College of Education faculty is the EdD in Instructional Leadership, concentration in Nurse Education. However, an acceptable short form (preferably after the formal name has been used) is the “EdD for nurse educators” (the difference is “in Nurse Education” vs. “for nurse educators”). The phrase “nurse educators” should generally be lowercase, but can be capitalized in lists, etc. when used to help clarify the degree’s purpose.
