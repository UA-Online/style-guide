Hyphenated as “decision-making” for noun or adjective.[^40]

[^40]: An earlier version of Strategic Communications differed from AP “Ask the Editor” ([https://www.apstylebook.com/ask\_the\_editors/27610](https://www.apstylebook.com/ask_the_editors/27610)) on “decision-making.” Recent versions of the Strategic Communications editorial guide omit their guidance; at the same time, Webster’s also specifies “decision-making” in all uses.
