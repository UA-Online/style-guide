# addresses

In publications, it’s Marketing custom not to list box numbers or fax numbers. Most contact blocks include name, position, phone number and email. State the specific college only if it’s otherwise unclear from the rest of the material or for an interdisciplinary degree. Usually it’s not necessary to include “The University of Alabama” in a contact block. For instance:

Dr. Jane Smith  
Faculty Program Coordinator  
205-555-1212  
person.name@ua.edu
