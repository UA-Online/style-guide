# colon (:)

Capitalize the first word after a colon only if it is a proper noun or the start of a complete sentence: _He promised this: The surgery would repair the lower intestine_, but _There were three dessert choices: cake, pie and Jell-O._[^8]

### Lists
A colon should not be used before a list of items that completes the sentence as a direct object. If a sentence would be understandable without the colon, omit the colon.
