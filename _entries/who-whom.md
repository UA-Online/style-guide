“Who” is used as the subject of a sentence and “whom” is used as the object of a sentence. If you can answer the question or replace the word with “he,” “she,” or “they,” then it should be “who”; if you can answer the question or replace the word with “him,” “her,” or “them,” then it should be “whom.”
