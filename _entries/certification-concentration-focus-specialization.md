# certification, concentration, focus, specialization

For documents like the annual UA Online Guide brochure, there is different punctuation for listing certificates, concentrations, focuses and specializations. Focuses get parenthesis, specializations and concentrations get “specialization/concentration in” (set off by comma) and certifications are just set off by commas after the degree name and major. Use these standards as a guide, though usage may differ depending on the document.

*   Certification: MA in Educational Leadership, Instructional Leadership P-12 Certification
*   Concentration: MS in Consumer Sciences, concentration in Family Financial Planning & Counseling
*   Focus: MS in HES (Consumer Quality Management)
*   Specialization: MA in Communication Studies, specialization in Organizational Leadership

Because “concentration” and “specialization” (also “conditional”) are specific degree program terms, they should not be used often except in reference to those programs. Avoid the phrase “conditional admission.”
