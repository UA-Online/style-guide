# directions, regions

Lowercase “north,” “south,” “northeast,” “southern,” etc., when they indicate compass direction; capitalize these words when they designate widely known regions.

_The cold front is moving east. A storm system that developed in the Midwest is spreading eastward._ _It will bring showers to the East Coast by morning and to the entire Northeast by late in the day._ _She has a Southern accent. This scholarship is for students from south Alabama._

## With names of nations
Lowercase directions unless they are part of a proper name or are used to designate a politically divided nation: _northern France, eastern Canada, the western United States, but Northern Ireland, South Korea_.

## With states and cities
Lowercase directions when referring to a section of a state or city, but capitalize when part of a proper name: _western Montana,_ _southern Atlanta_, but _North Dakota, West Virginia_. Capitalize for widely known sections: _the South Side of Chicago, the Lower East Side of New York_. When in doubt, use lowercase.[^42]
