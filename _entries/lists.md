# lists

Vertical lists may be bulleted or numbered/lettered.

When bulleted items are sentences, capitalize the first letter of each sentence and use appropriate ending punctuation. When bulleted items consist of single words or phrases, lowercase the first letter and do not use punctuation.

Strive for consistency. If one item in a bulleted list has a period, end all the items with a period even if they’re not all sentences (but try not to mix-and-match sentences and non-sentences). If some items begin with verbs, begin all items with verbs.

_The benefits of membership include:_

*   _special invitations to all UA sporting events_

*   _a Sports Club hangtag_
*   _a free T-shirt for members and their spouses_

_To help make your college experience a pleasant and successful one, keep these suggestions in mind:_

*   _Register for classes._
*   _Show up for classes._
*   _Buy the required books._
*   _Graduate!_[^15]

Use numbered or lettered lists (numbered preferred) when referring back to an item (“see number 15 above”); otherwise consider using bullets. Also use numbered lists when a sequence of steps is implied. Use 1. or a. without parenthesis.

1.  _Download the application file._
2.  _Pay the application fee through the online system._
3.  _Upload your completed application and select “Submit.”_

### Run-in list
 A run-in list usually does not need a colon, especially if the list items are part of the sentence.

*   Incorrect: _Positions include: quarterback, running back and lineman_.
*   Correct: _Positions include quarterback, running back and lineman_.

If the text will need to refer back to items in a run-in list, use letters or numbers enclosed in parentheses. Use commas or semicolons to separate these items exactly as if there were no numbers or letters. _They decided to (1) introduce a new program, (2) advertise it and (3) enroll students._
