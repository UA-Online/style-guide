For accessibility purposes, it’s Marketing custom to avoid the use of “click here” when possible. A better practice is to hyperlink relevant words (“admissions information” in “Review the most current admissions information,” “website” in “Visit our website”) or phrases like “select an option below to learn more,” “learn more here,” or “find out more.”
