# publication titles

Italicize most publication titles.[^17] For magazines, capitalize and italicize “magazine” only if it’s part of the formal name of the publication — _Harper’s Magazine_ versus _Newsweek_ magazine (see each magazine website’s “About Us” page for usage).[^18] Television program names are italicized, but segments on television shows appear in quotation marks. Website names are not italicized, and the italicized name of a publication might not be italicized when referring to the website (_New York Times_ versus the New York Times website).
