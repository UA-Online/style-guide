# course numbers, course titles

The parts of a course name are the alpha symbol (EN), course number (101) and title (English Composition). When an alpha symbol, number and title are given together, there is no punctuation between the course number and title. When possible, try not to abbreviate words in the course title.

*   ART 224 Introduction to Digital Art
*   EE 350 Electromechanics
*   EN 398 Modernism I: The Cultural Context

When a course title is given without the course number, uppercase the course title as long as it is the complete title: _Introduction to Art History_.

Do not use alpha symbols when referring generally to a department or programâ€™s courses or an academic discipline.

*   Incorrect: Students may count up to 18 hours in SOC, FR or PSC toward the major.
*   Correct: Students may count up to 18 hours in sociology, French or political science toward the major.

When listing courses by number, repeat the alpha symbol with each number.

*   Incorrect: The required courses include EN 101, 205, and 209 or 210.
*   Correct: The required courses include EN 101, EN 205, and EN 209 or EN 210.

Use a colon to indicate two courses that are lecture-and-laboratory combinations: _AY 101:102_. The alpha symbol is not repeated.

Cross-listed courses offered for both undergraduate and graduate credit with two course numbers may be written with a slash: _EN 480/580_. The alpha symbol is not repeated.

Do not use a colon or a slash with courses except to indicate lecture-and-laboratory or cross-listed courses.[^79]
