# Educational Specialist

EdS is an acceptable abbreviation on first usage, but if necessary, this is spelled out and capitalized as Educational Specialist (not Education Specialist) in marketing materials and public-facing products.[^43] Capitalize “specialist” when spelled out in formal degree names (“Educational Specialist in Special Education”), but lowercase when not referring to a degree, like “child life specialist.”
