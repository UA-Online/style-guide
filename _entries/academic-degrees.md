# academic degrees

Degree names are possessive when the word “degree” is present or understood (bachelor’s, master’s degree, but “associate” is not possessive in “associate degree”). Degree names are never possessive in the case of Bachelor of Arts, Master of Science, Juris Master, or etc.

EdS is the abbreviation for Educational Specialist (not education specialist).

Doctoral is an adjective; doctorate is a noun. Refer to the degree as a doctorate or a doctoral degree, not a doctorate degree.

Do not use periods in degree name abbreviations unless specifically mandated by the department.[^25]

M&R always capitalizes majors/specialties in degree names: _Master of Science in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics, master’s in Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics._[^26]

We do not use periods in degree abbreviations per Strategic Communications, though the AP Stylebook disagrees.

[^26]: Capitalizing the specialty in regard to the degree program is M&R custom, in contrast to AP guidance.
