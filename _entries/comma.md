# comma (,)

The University of Alabama follows Associated Press style, which does not use the serial or Oxford comma (omit the comma before the conjunction in most sentences): _The flag is red, white and blue. They would nominate Nick, Terry or Paul._

Include a final comma in a simple series if omitting it could make the meaning unclear. _At the graduation reception I met my professors, Big Al and President Bell_ (where Big Al and President Bell could be interpreted as the professors) versus _At the graduation reception, I met my professors, Big Al, and President Bell._

### Names of states and nations used with city names
 _His journey will take him from Dublin, Ireland, to Fargo, North Dakota, and back. The Selma, Alabama, group saw the governor._

### Separating similar words
 Use a comma to separate duplicated words: _What the problem is, is not clear._

### Placement with quotes
 Commas always go inside quotation marks.

### With conjunctions
 Use a comma when “and,” “but” or “for” links two clauses that could be their own sentences: _Alabama is a great school, and I will be proud to graduate from there._ The comma can be dropped if the clauses are short: _We went to Lakeside and I ate ice cream._

Do not use a comma when the subject of two clauses is not repeated in the second clause: _We went to Coleman Coliseum and saw the players. We went to Coleman Coliseum, and we saw the players._

### With equal adjectives
 Use commas to separate equal adjectives where “and” could be substituted instead: _a distance, accredited business program_ (a program that’s both distance and accredited). Do not use a comma when the adjectives are not equal or one adjective modifies the other: _a weekend distance program_ (distance programs only offered on the weekends).

### With full dates
 When a phrase refers to a month, day and year, set off the year with a comma: _February 14, 2030, is the target date_.[^10]
