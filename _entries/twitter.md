# X/Twitter

Write X/Twitter handles with an @ symbol: _We announced the information session through the UA Online account (@UAOnline)._ If the word “at” would be used in the sentence, omit it before the handle (_You can reach us @UAOnline_), though a better option is to rewrite the sentence so it doesn’t use the understood “at” (_You can reach @UAOnline on X/Twitter_).[^22]
