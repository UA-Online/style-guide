# specialist, specialization

Capitalize for Educational Specialist (where EdS is a formal degree, like _Educational Specialist in Special Education_), but lowercase when not referring to a degree, like “child life specialist.”

“Specialization” does not tend to be capitalized when describing the formal name of a program (“Master of Science in Marketing with a specialization in Marketing Analytics”).
